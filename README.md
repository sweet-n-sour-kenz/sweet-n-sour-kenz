- 👋 Hi, I’m Kenzie (she/they)
- 👀 I’m interested in way too many topics, but I always come back to cartoons.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java (in a Linear Data Structures class)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now (but maybe a simple 2D video game in the future)
- 📫 How to reach me ... Please don't.
